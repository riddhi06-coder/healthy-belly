        <h3>Crafting Delightful and Nutritious Indian Sweets</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Healthy Belly began its journey in 1989 with Harsnishji, a dedicated milkman who supplied fresh milk to households from 1982 to 1989. Driven by a passion for creating delightful sweets, Harsnishji transitioned from milk delivery to manufacturing traditional Indian sweets like milk peda and barfis, starting a new chapter in his culinary adventure. </p>
