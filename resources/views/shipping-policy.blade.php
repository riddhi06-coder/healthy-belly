        </div>
        <p>We offer delivery on most of our items. Due to the nature of some products, certain items are in-store pickup only.  <br>
For deliverable items, orders are shipped the same day when placed before 10am Sunday - Wednesday, subject to availability! In the instance a selected item is unavailable, The Mithai Box's team will contact you. Please allow a minimum of 1-2 days for delivery.<br>
Due to COVID-19, please allow additional lead times when placing your orders as there may be possible delays to deliveries. Although we only ship on next day delivery, once the parcels are with our courier partner, we have no control. <br>
For this reason, we only ship on Sunday to Wednesday so that orders are not held up over the weekend. Weekend deliveries are currently not available - orders received from Thursday to Saturday will be despatched on Sunday.<br>
All items for sale on our website for shipping have an ambient shelf life of at least one week, so there is very little chance of any item spoiling. <br>
If you would like more information, please call our customer service team on +44 1753 823308 during 11am to 7pm
 <br>
Due to COVID-19, please allow additional lead times when placing your orders as there may be possible delays to deliveries.
A signature is required on delivery. If you think you may not be in to receive delivery, please specify any special instructions to The Mithai Box's Team i.e. leave with a neighbour by calling us on +44 1753 823308.<br>
We specifically request customers to be at their delivery address to receive their goods on the day they are informed they will receive it. If no one is available to accept delivery or if goods become unsuitable as a result of non-delivery we cannot accept liability and customers may face a re-delivery charge at the discretion of the courier company.</p>
